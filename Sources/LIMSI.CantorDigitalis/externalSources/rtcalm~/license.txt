This software, the Cantor Digitalis, is a singing synthesis computer 
program made of a digital formant synthesizer driven by one or several 
control interfaces. 
It is composed of two main Max patches. The first, the synthesis engine, is based on an improved version 
of the parallel formant synthesis design implementing the linear 
acoustic source-filter model of speech production. 
The "filter" or 
"vocal tract" part of the system is computed using a parallel structure 
made of 5 digital second-order resonators. The parameters of these 
filters are their center frequencies, gains and bandwidths. They are 
combined for controlling vowels, according to synthesis rules. 
The "source" or "glottal flow derivative" part of the system is 
computed using the Causal-Anticausal Linear Model CALM. The CALM 
parameters are combined for controlling four vocal dimensions: voice 
tension, breathiness, roughness, and vocal effort. Compared to a 
classical parallel formant synthesizer, Cantor Digitalis is featuring 
several improvements, including presets for voice categories (baritone, 
tenor, alto, soprano), voice range profiles, source-filter dependencies 
(formant and harmonic tuning), high F0 resolution, vocal tract size, 
vocalic space and voice quality control.
The second main Max patch, the tablet data processor, is used to receive 
the data from the graphic tablet and send them to the synthesis engine.
